            <p>Hello, my name is Yanis HASNI, I am 19 years old, I live in Strasbourg, more precisely in Blaesheim. I have been passionate about football since I was little
                I started playing football at 6 years old and I am also passionate about computers.
                I am currently in BUT 1st year of network and telecommunications at the University of Colmar.
                I did a STI2D baccalaureate specializing in SIN in Strasbourg at the Louis Couffignal high school. After my baccalaureate I first studied computer science which
                was located in Strasbourg but the GOAL was no longer there so I decided to change at the end of the year and reorient myself.
            </p>
